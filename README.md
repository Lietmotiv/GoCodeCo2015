#Overview

We cannot wait to meet everyone and geek out on Colorado open data at the Go Code Colorado events.  This repo is to provide you a quickstart to integrating to Mercury APIs if you would like to add a payments component to your product.

As you can see from the list above we have made our:  HostedCheckout, MobileWallets, REST, and SOAP integrations available to you for your hacking pleasure.

REST/SOAP are a transmission mechanism but specifically provide access to our Credit, Debit, EBT, PrePaid products.

#Samples in this repo

We use curl to facilitate transaction processing in this repo as it is a simple utility and easily installed (if not installed by default).  But have a look around at our sample code and you will start to see an infinite number of ways to send transactions to the Mercury platform.
